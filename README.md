# Rendere

My little render project, where my goal is to make a 3D render (maybe a 2D too) with OpenGL.
Using VisualStudio as IDEA, with the aid of Glad and GLFW liberies.

Written in C++
runs 64bit

Note: Due to GLFW being a libery tailored for your OS and PC, you'll need to build your own libery. This can be done with Cmake.
	 Remember to get a GLAD.c files and add it to your root folder.
